            <p> Well, I've built a basic blog website using very basic html and css.
            I used this handy app called <a href="http://mimo.com">Mimo</a> to get the
          basics in place. I am hoping I can build on this to not only make this blog
        better but also as the basis for future projects (of which I don't have any yet). </p>
            <p> I am sort of starting to wonder if anyone actually learns everything
              they need to know when coding, or whether they just google it when they
              aren't sure. For most of this blog, I have either tweaked something
              I have used before or googled it and it seems to be working!</p>
              <p> I only added this post to try out the alternating post background
                using a "pseudo-class" in CSS...easy! </p>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p> I'm <strong>coding</strong> this blog! Crazy times! </p>
            <p> So far, it's actually pretty simple but there is a lot to remember, kind of like
              learning a new language. I feel like it is one of those things that you have
              to just practice every day and keep doing new projects in order to get better
              at it. </p>
            <p>I have learnt SQL (Structured Query Language) at work and I remember
              the first time I saw it. I was thinking, there is no way am I going to be able to do
              that but actually I committed an hour or so a week to learning it,
              including playing around in the databases challenging myself to find new data.
            Soon enough I was all over it, and even after a few months became a "Go-to guy" for
            SQL. I feel like this is going to be the same. The only challenge is that I don't
            <em> <strong> have </strong> </em> to do this for work... </p>
            <p> P.S - see what I did there making coding bold and have bold and
              italic using code...ooo fancy! </p>

            <p> <em>Chris</em> is a struggle at the best of times, let alone
              when he is trying to learn to code. Just kidding, but seriously it (the code not Chris...?)
              just looks so weird - loads of little lines, dots, squiggles and
              random words all together, I don't really understand it all. </p>
            <p> I mean I get why he is doing it and he is clearly a super genius but still. </p>
            <p> Teddy is only just 2 years old so we've got <strong>aggggges</strong>
              before we have to start thinking about it...haven't we?</p>
            <p> Oh and by the way, my <strong><a href="wordpress.com">blog</a></strong>
              is much better - it has got cakes and everything... #justsaying</p>

            <p> Oh and by the by the way, this is Chris, I just needed to test
              out having a second post author! </p>
